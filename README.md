# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
In this project we created three different projects with the help of google maps to help customers with their vacation decisions.
### First Project
In the first project, we created a database for different cities around the world with their weather details to include max temperature and humidity.
### Second Project
In this project we created a map of hotels with the help of google maps using the database from first project. We also gave the user an optiont to enter min and max temperature of destination he wants to visit. With this information system creates a new data base for hotels in the cities with desired temperature range, and shows to the user in form of a map.
### Third Project
In this project, we helped the user to select a route for road trip around 4 cities in Europe. We also used the information to provide a map of this route and all the required information for his hotels, city and weather conditions.
